# LangGraph-Corractive-RAG-Local-LLM

One of the concerns with modern AI chatbots is their hallucinations This means they might give answers that are wrong or made-up.

AI chatbots and text generators can be pretty unpredictable, especially even if you learn how to prompt effectively.

If you leave AI models with more freedom, they might provide inaccurate or even contradicting information.

In this video, we're going to look closely at what is Corrective RAG, how the Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG) process works, what is the difference between RAG and CRAG and how to use langGraph, Corrective RAG and any local model or paid model you would like to use to create a Powerful Rag Chatbot.
